0.06 Sat Apr 16 19:22:54 CEST 2011
     - fix minor documentation typo
     - don't test inf and nan under MSWin32
     - add an interface to the parser
     - take advantage of typemaps and declarations to minimize
       XS code

0.05 Thu Apr 14 10:26:20 CEST 2011
     - use aTHX_ when Perl_croak-ing to work on threaded Perls
     - only test inf and nan on Perl 5.8.8 and later

0.04 Wed Apr 13 17:09:21 CEST 2011
     - use 4 instead of 1.23 for testing doubles, as we can't test
       it in a cross-platform way
     - work around not finding isinf under Solaris
     - add const char * to the typemap to support Perl 5.6
     - throw exceptions upon YAJL error states

0.03 Tue Apr 12 09:56:35 CEST 2011
     - define NEED_newSVpvn_flags and NEED_sv_2pv_flags, as suggested
       by ppport.h (this should fix compilation problems with older
       Perls)
     - do not ship a Makefile.PL
     - do not include stdint.h as we do not need it

0.02 Mon Apr 11 15:39:18 CEST 2011

0.01 Mon Apr 11 11:46:04 CEST 2011
     - initial release
