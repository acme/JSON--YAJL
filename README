NAME
    JSON::YAJL - An interface to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation
    library

SYNOPSIS
      use JSON::YAJL;
      # see JSON::YAJL::Generator

DESCRIPTION
    YAJL is Yet Another JSON Library. YAJL is a small event-driven
    (SAX-style) JSON parser written in ANSI C, and a small validating JSON
    generator, by Lloyd Hilaiel This module is a Perl interface to that
    library.

    At the moment this only wraps the generation library, see
    JSON::YAJL::Generator. Patches for parsing welcome.

    This is a very early release to see how cross-platform the underlying
    code is. The API may change in future.
